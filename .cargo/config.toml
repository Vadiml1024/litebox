# Cargo configuration for faster builds and better development experience
#
# This configuration provides optional optimizations that can significantly
# speed up compilation and linking times for local development.

# =============================================================================
# FAST LINKER CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
# =============================================================================
# Using a faster linker can reduce link times by 50-70% on large projects.
# Uncomment ONE of the options below based on what you have installed:

# Option 1: mold - Fastest linker for Linux (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
# Install: sudo apt install mold  or  cargo install --locked mold
# Typical speedup: 3-5x faster than GNU ld
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=mold"]

# Option 2: lld - Fast cross-platform linker from LLVM
# Install: sudo apt install lld
# Typical speedup: 2-3x faster than GNU ld
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# Option 3: System default linker (currently active)
# No configuration needed - this is what you're using now

# =============================================================================
# CARGO ALIASES FOR COMMON TASKS
# =============================================================================
