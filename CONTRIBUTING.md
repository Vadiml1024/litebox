## Development Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

For the fastest development experience, install these optional but highly recommended tools:

```bash
# Fast linker (choose one) - speeds up linking by 3-5x
sudo apt install mold        # Recommended
# OR
sudo apt install lld         # Alternative

# Fast test runner - speeds up tests by 2-3x
cargo install cargo-nextest

# After installing, edit .cargo/config.toml to enable the fast linker
```

For more optimization tips, see [Workspace Setup Optimization Guide](./docs/workspace_setup_optimization.md).

### Prerequisites

#### Rust Toolchain

This project uses Rust nightly. Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

The repository includes a `rust-toolchain.toml` file that specifies the exact nightly version to use.

#### System Dependencies

**For Windows on Linux Development:**

If you're working on Windows-on-Linux support, you'll need the MinGW cross-compiler toolchain to build Windows test programs:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mingw-w64

# Add Windows GNU target to Rust
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

This enables:
- Cross-compiling Rust programs to Windows PE format
- Building test executables in `windows_test_programs/`
- Testing the Windows-on-Linux runner with real Windows binaries

**Other Development Tools:**

```bash
# cargo-nextest for faster test execution (optional but recommended)
cargo install cargo-nextest

# For debugging Windows programs (optional)
sudo apt-get install -y gdb
```

### Building

Build the entire workspace:

```bash
cargo build
```

Build specific packages:

```bash
# Windows on Linux components
cargo build -p litebox_shim_windows
cargo build -p litebox_platform_linux_for_windows
cargo build -p litebox_runner_windows_on_linux_userland

# Other components
cargo build -p litebox
cargo build -p litebox_runner_linux_userland
```

### Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
# Or with cargo-nextest
cargo nextest run
```

Run tests for specific packages:

```bash
# Windows on Linux tests
cargo test -p litebox_shim_windows -p litebox_platform_linux_for_windows -p litebox_runner_windows_on_linux_userland

# With nextest
cargo nextest run -p litebox_shim_windows
```

### Building Windows Test Programs

If you've installed MinGW (see above), you can build the Windows test programs:

```bash
cd windows_test_programs

# Build all test programs for Windows
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release

# Build specific test program
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release -p hello_cli
```

The built executables will be in:
```
windows_test_programs/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/*.exe
```

### Running Windows Programs on Linux

After building the Windows test programs, you can run them with the Windows-on-Linux runner:

```bash
cargo run -p litebox_runner_windows_on_linux_userland -- \
  windows_test_programs/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/hello_cli.exe
```

### Code Quality

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for common mistakes and style issues
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Run ratchet tests (verify constraints)
cargo test -p dev_tests

# Run all tests
cargo nextest run  # or cargo test
```

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed coding standards and development guidelines.
